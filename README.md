created a stock market analysis dashboard on power bi

Overview

This repository contains the Power BI Stock Market Analysis Dashboard that I developed to provide insights into various key financial metrics for some of the top stocks, including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Netflix (NFLX). The dashboard helps in analyzing and visualizing stock market data, including trading volumes, price changes, volatility, and more.

Features

Average Daily Volume by Ticker: This chart displays the average daily trading volume for each stock ticker, helping to identify investor interest levels.

Volatility by Ticker: A pie chart that shows the price volatility of each stock, enabling the identification of the most and least volatile stocks.

Monthly Performance: Line chart that tracks the sum of closing prices for each ticker over several months, allowing for trend analysis.

Scatter Plot of Total Volume vs. Daily Price Change: This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between total trading volume and daily price changes, helping to explore the correlation between market activity and stock price movements.
