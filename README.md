# Overview

This repository contains the Power BI Stock Market Analysis Dashboard that I developed to provide insights into various key financial metrics for some of the top stocks, including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Netflix (NFLX). The dashboard helps in analyzing and visualizing stock market data, including trading volumes, price changes, volatility, and more.

# Features

Average Daily Volume by Ticker: This chart displays the average daily trading volume for each stock ticker, helping to identify investor interest levels.

Volatility by Ticker: A pie chart that shows the price volatility of each stock, enabling the identification of the most and least volatile stocks.

Monthly Performance: Line chart that tracks the sum of closing prices for each ticker over several months, allowing for trend analysis.

Scatter Plot of Total Volume vs. Daily Price Change: This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between total trading volume and daily price changes, helping to explore the correlation between market activity and stock price movements.

# insights

AAPL (Apple) has the highest average daily trading volume, exceeding 60M shares.

MSFT (Microsoft) and  GOOG (google) comes next with a volume around 30M.

 Netflix have the lowest.

Volatility by Ticker:

NFLX shows the highest volatility (37.2%), followed by MSFT(35.44%). These stocks are the most volatile in this analysis.

AAPL is less volatile, accounting for 14.76%, while GOOG is the least volatile with only 12.59%.

Sum of Close by Month and Ticker:

NFLX has the highest closing prices over time, peaking in March and slightly dropping towards May.

MSFT follows a similar trend, with a steady increase in prices up to March before seeing a decline in May.

GOOG and NFLX maintain lower closing prices compared to the others, with more gradual price movements

Total Volume vs. Daily Price Change:

There is a strong clustering of high volume and minor price changes for AAPL, MSFT, and GOOG, especially at low price deviations.

Larger price changes are associated with lower volumes, indicating that substantial price shifts may not coincide with the highest trading volumes.

NFLX tends to have smaller bubbles, meaning lower volumes and less dramatic price movements.
